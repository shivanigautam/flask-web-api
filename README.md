# flask-web-api
Flask Web API for Transaction
For the first time to run this web api you need to run  localhost:5000/ to create database table but please edit your database configuration in UserHistory.py python file.
this project is having three function in one api called localhost:5000/payment this project is based on transaction of payment according to availability of Payment Gateway Method.

just simply run the web_api.py file, for some reference and test cases you can use TestCase.txt file which is attached in it.

Thanks & Regards
